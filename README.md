# bootstrap-sass-bones

Bootstrap SASS Bones is a bare-bones personal version of the bootstrap-sass port.  It contains everything ready to start a Bootstrap SASS project immediately.  It even has a premade Compass config.rb file so you can start watching/compiling changes to the source files by simply opening the terminal, cd to project directory, and run "compass watch" in the terminal to poll for changes.
